## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Git** - Must be installed and accessible from command line
- **cloc** - Count Lines of Code tool for language detection and statistics
- **Unix-like environment** - Linux or macOS recommended (Windows with WSL should work)

### Installing cloc

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install cloc
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cloc
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo dnf install cloc
```

**From source:**
```bash
# Download and install from https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc
```

**Note:** The tool will still work without `cloc`, but language statistics will show as "Unknown".

### Python Dependencies
```
flask
```

Install with:
```bash
pip3 install flask
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get install git cloc  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install git cloc          # macOS

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install flask
```

### 2. Clone and Start
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd reposquirrel
python3 dashboard_server.py
```

### 3. Configure via Web UI
Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

From the dashboard, you can:
- **Clone repositories** - Add Git repositories directly through the UI
- **Configure teams** - Set up developer teams and members
- **Define subsystems** - Map repositories to services/components
- **Set up aliases** - Consolidate user identities
- **Generate analytics** - Run analysis for specific time periods
- **View statistics** - Browse developer and subsystem insights

**That's it!** All configuration and repository management can be done through the web interface.

## Usage

### Web Dashboard

The dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring your analytics data.

**Starting the server:**
```bash
python3 dashboard_server.py
```

**Features:**
- Browse developer statistics and contributions
- View subsystem ownership and trends
- Explore team performance
- Configure repositories and teams through the UI
- Real-time progress for data generation

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in the `configuration/` directory. You can edit them manually or through the web dashboard.

### services.json
Defines how repositories are organized into services/subsystems:

```json
{
  "repo-name": {
    "service1": ["service1/"],
    "service2": ["service2/"],
    "main": [""]
  }
}
```

### teams.json
Organizes developers into teams:

```json
{
  "team-id": {
    "name": "Team Display Name",
    "description": "Team description",
    "members": ["user1", "user2", "user3"]
  }
}
```

### alias.json
Maps alternative usernames to canonical names:

```json
{
  "canonical-username": ["alias1", "alias2"],
  "other-user": ["alternative-name"]
}
```

### team_subsystem_responsibilities.json
Links teams to subsystems they own:

```json
{
  "team-id": ["subsystem1", "subsystem2"],
  "other-team": ["subsystem3"]
}
```

### ignore_user.txt
List of usernames to exclude (one per line):
```
bot-account
automated-user
ci-bot
```

## How It Works

1. **Repository Scanning** - The tool scans Git repositories in the specified directory
2. **Commit Analysis** - For each month, it analyzes commits using `git log` with statistics
3. **Attribution** - Commits are attributed to developers, with alias resolution
4. **Subsystem Mapping** - Files are mapped to services/subsystems based on configuration
5. **Blame Analysis** - `git blame` determines current ownership of each line of code
6. **Aggregation** - Data is aggregated by user, team, subsystem, and time period
7. **Dashboard** - Web interface provides interactive exploration of the data

## Use Cases

- **Code ownership tracking** - Who owns what parts of the codebase?
- **Team performance metrics** - How much is each team contributing?
- **Subsystem health** - Which components are actively maintained?
- **Historical analysis** - How has contribution changed over time?
- **Onboarding insights** - Who are the experts in each area?
- **Resource planning** - Where is development effort being spent?
